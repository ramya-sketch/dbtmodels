  One row per dbt run: staging + fact row counts and distinct claim grain on the fact.
  Compare to the previous run in this table to see net change (ingest / merge health)
  without trusting run_results.rows_affected on Snowflake CTAS.

  - net_* = 0 → no net change vs last run (still useful for SLA “we ran” audit).
  - src_claim_rows_* → counts straight from ZTEST.CLAIM for “did source change Today”.
